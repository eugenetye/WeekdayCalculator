# Weekday Calculator
This is a Python program to determine the day of the week a person was born given his or her birthday. 

## Project Description
The reference date 01/01/1920, which is a Thursday, is used for this program. The user will be asked for an input of a birthday in the form of mm/dd/yyyy, which will be split into month, day, and year respectively. The day of the birthdate is determined by counting the number of days from the reference date to the birthdate. 

*The user's birthdate is assumed to be greater than the reference date.*
