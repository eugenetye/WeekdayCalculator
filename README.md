# Weekday Calculator
This is a Python program to determine the day of the week a person was born given his or her birthday. 

## Project Description
The reference date 01/01/1920, which is a Thursday, is used for this program. The user will be asked for an input of a birthday in the form of mm/dd/yyyy, which will be split into month, day, and year respectively. The day of the birthdate is determined by counting the number of days from the reference date to the birthdate. 

Three scenarios will be encountered in this program:
1. There is more than one year between the two dates
2. The user's birthdate is in the next year after the reference date
3. The user's birthdate and reference date are both in the same year. In this case, no years are involved in the calculation.

*The user's birthdate is assumed to be greater than the reference date.*
